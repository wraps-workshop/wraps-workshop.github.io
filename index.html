                    <p class="lead mb-4 mx-5">Emerging technologies (e.g. IoT, AR/VR, AI/ML, etc.) are increasingly being deployed in new and innovative ways – be it in our homes, vehicles, or public spaces. Such technolgies have the potential to bring a wide range of benefits, blending advanced functionality with the physical environment. However, they also have the potential to drive real-world consequences through decisions, interactions, or actuations, and there is a real risk that their use can lead to harms, such as physical injuries, financial loss, or even death. These concerns appear ever-more prevalent, as a growing sense of distrust has led to calls for <b>more transparency and accountability</b> surrounding the development and use of emerging technologies.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-4 mx-5">A range of things can—and often <em>do</em>—go wrong, be they technical failure, user error, or otherwise. As such, means for the ability to <b>review, understand and act upon</b> the inner workings of how these systems are built/developed and used are crucial to being able to determine the cause of failures, prevent re-occurrences, and/or to identify parties at fault. Yet, despite the wider landscape of societal and legal pressures for record keeping and increased accountability (e.g. GDPR and CCPA), implementing transparency measures face a range of challenges.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-4 mx-5">This calls for different thinking into how we can better understand (interpret) the emerging technologies that pervade our world. As such, this workshop aims to explore new ideas into the nascent topic, collating some of the outstanding challenges and potential solutions to implementing more meaningful transparency throughout pervasive systems. We look to bring together experts from a range of disciplines, including those of technical, legal, and design-oriented backgrounds.</p>


                    <p class="lead mb-4 mx-5">This workshop is organised by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.compacctsys.net/">Compliant and Accountable Systems Group</a> (University of Cambridge) and the <a target="_blank" href="https://rainsprojectdotorg.wordpress.com/">Realising Accountable Intelligent Systems (RAInS) project</a>.</p>
